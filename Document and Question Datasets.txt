1. Document Datasets (Structured Data Files)

- muaggatt.txt: USDA SSURGO soil component attributes (pH, organic matter, texture, etc.)
- mapunit.txt: Mapping of soil units to regions (mukey, area symbol, acres)
- data_core.csv: Crop-to-soil compatibility data from Kaggle (Crop Type, Soil Type, Conditions)
- soil_data.db: Final SQLite database created by merging the above datasets for structured queries

These datasets are used to perform structured lookups for soil properties, crop suitability, and climate-aware crop recommendations within the TerraGPT assistant.
